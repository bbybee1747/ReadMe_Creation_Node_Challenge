  ## Description
  This application will create an origin and functional ReadMe for any project. It is command line based to make it functional from any setting without having to write in everything from scratch.
  
  ## Installation
  Navigate to the file location on your computer and open the application using the "node index.js" command.

  ## Usage
  Once you have navigated to the file system containing the application then open it using the "node index.js" command. Once you press enter then you just follow the prompts until you have a professional quality readme file that you can use for your current project.
  
  ## Contributors
  This project was completed by myself with a little bit of help from Tara Means to sort out some of the more complicated coding involved.

  ## Tests
  Run the application through the terminal. It has passed all tests thus far, if there does pop up with a bug then you need to examine your file structures be sure that the pages are loaded into the correct file. You will see the file location on line 91 in the index.js file.

  ## Features
  I would like to add an option in the prompts for file destination that would open up a local file location of your choosing to add the generated file into your local storage.
